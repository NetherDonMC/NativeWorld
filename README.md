## About
A **Minecraft mod** that makes gameplay more challenging using a new **spatial decay** mechanic.

You will no longer be able to stay in other dimensions for an unlimited amount of time. After spending some time in an unsafe dimension, the player will be affected by the **spatial decay** effect, which will gradually kill them. 

By using **spatial resistance potion** and **totems of birth**, you can avoid the negative effects of dimensions.
